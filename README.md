# snyk/broker

Snyk Broker proxies access between snyk.io and your Git repositories, such as GitHub Enterprise, GitHub.com and Bitbucket Server. Snyk Broker can also be used to enable a secure connection with your on-premise Jira deployment.

The Broker server and client establish an applicative tunnel, proxying requests from snyk.io to the Git (fetching manifest files from monitored repositories), and vice versa (webhooks posted by the Git).

The Broker client runs within the user's internal network, keeping sensitive data such as Git tokens within the network perimeter. The applicative tunnel scans and adds only relevant requests to an approved list, narrowing down the access permissions to the bare minimum required for Snyk to actively monitor a repository.

## Usage

The Broker client is published as a set of Docker images, each configured for a specific Git. Standard and custom configuration is performed with environment variables as described below, per integration type.

### GitHub.com

To use the the Broker client with GitHub.com, run `docker pull snyk/broker:github-com`. The following environment variables are mandatory to configure the Broker client:

- `BROKER_TOKEN` - the Snyk Broker token, obtained from your Snyk Org settings view (app.snyk.io).
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - a personal access token with full `repo`, `read:org` and `admin:repo_hook` scopes.
- `PORT` - the local port at which the Broker client accepts connections. Default is 7341.
- `BROKER_CLIENT_URL` - the full URL of the Broker client as it will be accessible by GitHub.com webhooks, such as `http://my.broker.client:7341`

#### Command-line arguments

You can run the Docker container by providing the relevant configuration:

```
docker run --restart=always \
           -p 8000:8000 \
           -e BROKER_TOKEN=secret-broker-token \
           -e GITHUB_TOKEN=secret-github-token \
           -e PORT=8000 \
           -e BROKER_CLIENT_URL=http://my.broker.client:8000 \
       snyk/broker:github-com
```

#### Derived docker image

Another option is to build your own docker image and override relevant environment variables:

```
FROM snyk/broker:github-com

ENV BROKER_TOKEN      secret-broker-token

ENV PORT                8000
```

### Monitoring

#### Healthcheck

The Broker exposes an endpoint at `/healthcheck`, which can be used to monitor the health of the running application. This endpoint responds with status code `200 OK` when the internal request is successful, and returns `{ ok: true }` in the response body.

In the case of the Broker client, this endpoint also reports on the status of the Broker websocket connection.  If the websocket connection is not open, this endpoint responds with status code `500 Internal Server Error` and `{ ok: false }` in the response body.

To change the location of the healthcheck endpoint, you can specify an alternative path via an environment variable:

```
ENV BROKER_HEALTHCHECK_PATH /path/to/healthcheck
```

#### Systemcheck

The Broker client exposes an endpoint at `/systemcheck`, which can be used to validate the brokered service (Git or the like) connectivity and credentials. This endpoint causes the Broker client to make a request to a preconfigured URL, and report on the success of the request. The supported configuration is:

* `BROKER_CLIENT_VALIDATION_URL` - the URL to which the request will be made.
* `BROKER_CLIENT_VALIDATION_AUTHORIZATION_HEADER` - [optional] the `Authorization` header value of the request. Mutually exclusive with `BROKER_CLIENT_VALIDATION_BASIC_AUTH`.
* `BROKER_CLIENT_VALIDATION_BASIC_AUTH` - [optional] the basic auth credentials (`username:password`) to be base64 encoded and placed in the `Authorization` header value of the request. Mutually exclusive with `BROKER_CLIENT_VALIDATION_AUTHORIZATION_HEADER`.
* `BROKER_CLIENT_VALIDATION_METHOD` - [optional] the HTTP method of the request (default is `GET`).
* `BROKER_CLIENT_VALIDATION_TIMEOUT_MS` - [optional] the request timeout in milliseconds (default is 5000 ms).

This endpoint responds with status code `200 OK` when the internal request is successful, and returns `{ ok: true }` in the response body. If the internal request fails, this endpoint responds with status code `500 Internal Server Error` and `{ ok: false }` in the response body.

To change the location of the systemcheck endpoint, you can specify an alternative path via an environment variable:

```
ENV BROKER_SYSTEMCHECK_PATH /path/to/systemcheck
```

#### Logging

By default the log level of the Broker is set to INFO. The following settings can be set in your environment variables to alter the logging behaviour.

| Key  | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| LOG_LEVEL  | info | Set to "debug" for all logs |
| LOG_ENABLE_BODY | false |   |


, to change this set the following environment variable:
`LOG_LEVEL=debug`

At this level all requests via the broker will be logged and show the [...]

If you wish to also log the body of these requests, set the following in your `.env` file: 
`LOG_ENABLE_BODY=true`

### Advanced Configuration

#### HTTPS

The Broker client runs an HTTP server by default. It can be configured to run an HTTPS server for local connections. This requires an SSL certificate and a private key to be provided to the docker container at runtime.

For example, if your certificate files are found locally at `./private/broker.crt` and `./private/broker.key`, provide these files to the docker container by mounting the folder and using the `HTTPS_CERT` and `HTTPS_KEY` environment variables:

```
docker run --restart=always \
           -p 8000:8000 \
           -e BROKER_TOKEN=secret-broker-token \
           -e GITHUB_TOKEN=secret-github-token \
           -e PORT=8000 \
           -e HTTPS_CERT=/private/broker.crt \
           -e HTTPS_KEY=/private/broker.key \
           -e BROKER_CLIENT_URL=https://my.broker.client:8000 \
           -v /local/path/to/private:/private \
       snyk/broker:github-com
```

Note that `BROKER_CLIENT_URL` now has the HTTPS scheme.

#### Git with an internal certificate

By default, the Broker client establishes HTTPS connections to the Git. If your Git is serving an internal certificate (signed by your own CA), you can provide the CA certificate to the Broker client.

For example, if your CA certificate is at `./private/ca.cert.pem`, provide it to the docker container by mounting the folder and using the `CA_CERT` environment variable:

```
docker run --restart=always \
           -p 8000:8000 \
           -e BROKER_TOKEN=secret-broker-token \
           -e BITBUCKET_USERNAME=username \
           -e BITBUCKET_PASSWORD=password \
           -e BITBUCKET=your.bitbucket-server.domain.com \
           -e BITBUCKET_API=your.bitbucket-server.domain.com/rest/api/1.0 \
           -e PORT=8000 \
           -e CA_CERT=/private/ca.cert.pem \
           -v /local/path/to/private:/private \
       snyk/broker:bitbucket-server
```

### Custom approved-listing filter

The default approved-listing filter supports the bare minimum to operate on all repositories supported by Snyk. In order to customize the approved-listing filter, create the default one locally by installing `snyk-broker` and running `broker init [Git type]`. The created `accept.json` is the default filter for the chosen Git. Place the file in a separate folder such as `./private/accept.json`, and provide it to the docker container by mounting the folder and using the `ACCEPT` environment variable:

```
docker run --restart=always \
           -p 8000:8000 \
           -e BROKER_TOKEN=secret-broker-token \
           -e GITHUB_TOKEN=secret-github-token \
           -e PORT=8000 \
           -e BROKER_CLIENT_URL=https://my.broker.client:8000 \
           -e ACCEPT=/private/accept.json
           -v /local/path/to/private:/private \
       snyk/broker:github-com
```

### Mounting Secrets
Sometime it is required to load sensitive configurations (GitHub/Snyk's token) from a file instead from environment variables. Broker is using [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to load the config, so the process is relatively simple:
* Create a file named `.env` and put your sensitive config there:
* Mount this file (for example, using [Kuberentes secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/distribute-credentials-secure/#create-a-pod-that-has-access-to-the-secret-data-through-a-volume)). Mount the file to be somewhere like `/broker`.
* Change the workdir of the docker image to be `/broker`/
Example of such file is located in your broker container at $HOME/.env
